            </p>

            <p class="posts">Enceladus is the sixth largest moon of Saturn with an average surface temperature of -200 degree
                celsius. It is the only known object in the solar system with active geysers in the “tiger stripes” area
                of the southern hemisphere of the Enceladus. There is also ample evidence that liquid water(salty)
                exists deep under the ice coverage of the moon. Further, the conditions of the icy planet comprise the
                best conditions for testing grounds to understand the origin of life on Earth. Data collected from the
                Cassini mission showed that these plumes consist of organic molecules like Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide,
                Methane, Ammonia, Argon, and the possibility of more complex organic structures. However, there still
                exists a large number of questions presently remaining unsolved about its internal structure, chemical
                makeup, possibility of life, and terrain. To understand and solve these mysteries, this paper presents
                a conceptual mission design study of a combined Satellite and Lander mission to aid in comprehensive
                testing and analysis of Enceladus’s surface. The main objective of the orbiter would be to maintain a
                stable orbit around Enceladus, performing preliminary assessment of the atmosphere and surface through
                observations in the multi-band spectrum with better resolution, terrain mapping, and composition of the
                atmosphere. A sample collection unit would be attached to the Orbiter, with which it would pass through
                the geysers and collect the gas and particulates of the moon. The samples would be further analysed
                through a spectrometer in the orbiter to examine the nature of these components, and complement and
                compare with the findings of the last scientific missions. These testings would include but not limited to
                understanding the characteristics of the gas and particulates of the geysers, comparing results with the
                Cassini mission to find if complex organic molecules have evolved, etc. Further, the Satellite would also
                have a gradiometer to study the differentiation in Enceladus’s core. The lander will contain a rover to map
                the internal structure of Enceladus through a seismometer, and perform spectral analysis to understand
                the chemical makeup of the surface. The mission will help scientists gather comprehensive data on the
                moon, laying the basis for the possibility of future habitat missions. This paper will conduct a study
                resulting in a comprehensive mission design and the technologies involved. This paper is submitted as
                part of the Space Exploration Project Group at the Space Generation Advisory Council.
